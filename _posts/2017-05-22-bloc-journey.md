I started Bloc on March 28th, 2017. It's been close to 2 months now and I must say that it has been a challenging yet fulfilling experience. I had some prior experience with coding on sites like FreeCodeCamp. So the initial weeks were not as brutal as for some of the other students that started on that date. 

After completing the initial few assignments, I was put in a interview setting where I was asked basic html, css and JavaScript questions. I must say that I was ill prepared for how official this interview/assessment process was. The entire interview was recorded to give us a chance to look back at our performance. I managed to answer most of the questions and passed even though I mumbled through most of the answers. 

The curriculum then transitioned into working with jQuery and I spent a week or so working on creating a music player using JavaScript and jQuery. There was a lot of code that was presented and a lot of the basic JavaScript logic was tested after the concepts were introduced. This section of the program did a decent job in guiding us along as well as leaving us alone to come up with some of the functionality. Personally, I would have preferred a little more isolated coding and challenges. But, given that most students had not coded before, it was more suitable that the assignments guided us along much more.

Moving on from the jQuery project, I moved into Angular JS and I began working on Bloc Jams. Angular made life a lot easier and I was able to write much less code while increasing speed and performance. In addition, I was presented with more challenging coding challenges then before. 

Next, we began coding on a chat app that worked with Angular and Firebase. This project is still in the works and so far, I have been able to log in user via google username and select a chat room where they can post their messages. The messages are saved into the database and almost immediately displayed in the chat room. The users also have the power to create their own chat rooms. I look add more functionality to this soon.
