## Transportation

Since 2006, I have been working at Dh Carriers, a mid sized transportation carrier company based out of Yuba City, CA. We specialize in hauling time and temperature sensative goods up and down the West Coast. At the age of 16, I helped start up the business with my family. Troughout the years, my role with the company has evolved in various ways. Currently, I'm the VP/operations manager and  I have 25 drivers/trucks under my supervision.

## Software

As far back as I can remember, I have had a passion and love for computers and technology. I had always enviosned myself one day being involved in the industry. In March 2017, I finally decided to take one step towards that vision. I enrolled at Bloc and started the software engineering course. I'm currently working with AngularJs and Firebase to make sclable and effiecnt web apps. I work on my projects during the week nights and weekends. 

## Farming

Aside from tranportation and tech, I'm also actively assisting in managing my farming operation. I'm part owner of a 25 acre Almond orchard in Sutter, CA. It has been a great and healthy challange in taking care of the trees. Currently, in their second year, the trees are healhty and lean.

## Everything else

When I'm not doing all the things above, I find myself playing basketball as often as possible. I have had a profound love for the game since childhood and played competetively till college. I also enjoy spending time withe my family and reading books.
